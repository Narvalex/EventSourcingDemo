# EventSourcingDemo - Demonstrate the event sourcing pattern using c# and EventStore by Dasith Wijesiriwardena
---------------------------------
This purpose of this project is to demonstrate the Event Sourcing design pattern using the EventStore (https://geteventstore.com/) and .NET
----------------------------------
Requirements:
•	A basic understanding of what Event Sourcing is. I recommend watching Greg Young's presentations and speeches about it on YouTube. 
Start with : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGkaShoyNs
•	Installation of EventStore (Optional, There is a built in InMemoryStorageProvider too)
"Event Store stores your data as a series of immutable events over time, making it easy to build event-sourced applications" - https://geteventstore.com/)
